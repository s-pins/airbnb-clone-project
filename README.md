# Airbnb Clone Project üè†

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that simulates the core features of Airbnb ‚Äî property listings, user authentication, bookings, and reviews.  
It‚Äôs designed to help developers gain hands-on experience in backend architecture, database design, API security, and CI/CD automation.

## Project Goals
- Build a scalable backend system using **Django** and **MySQL**.  
- Design a relational database that supports listings, bookings, and users.  
- Implement secure RESTful APIs with authentication and role-based access control.  
- Integrate **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.  
- Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
**Backend:** Django (Python)  
**Database:** MySQL  
**API Layer:** REST / GraphQL  
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
**Containerization:** Docker  

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthen collaborative development workflows.  
- Master backend design and deployment.  
- Apply modern security and DevOps best practices.  

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

Below is a breakdown of roles our team can adopt in the the Airbnb Clone project, borrowing structure ideas from ITRex‚Äôs team-structure blog. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

| Role | Responsibility in This Project |
|---|---|
| **Backend Developer** | Writes and maintains server-side logic. Implements endpoints for listings, bookings, user auth, etc. Ensures data flows correctly between controllers, services, and the database. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs the relational schema (tables, relations, indexes). Manages migrations, ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and handles backup/restore. |
| **Security Engineer / API Security Lead** | Integrates security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting). Oversees encryption, API token management, and guards against vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.). |
| **DevOps / CI-CD Engineer** | Sets up infrastructure automation (Docker, hosting). Creates CI/CD pipelines (e.g. via GitHub Actions) to build, test, and deploy changes. Monitors deployments and handles environment configurations. |
| **Quality Assurance (QA) / Test Engineer** | Tests endpoints and user flows to verify correctness. Writes test cases (manual and automated). Reports bugs and ensures features meet requirements. |
| **Product Owner / Feature Strategist** | Translates user needs into feature stories. Prioritizes the backlog. Ensures features align with project goals and user value. |
| **Software Architect / Technical Lead** | Defines the high-level architecture (how components interact). Chooses patterns, libraries, and frameworks. Enforces coding standards, reviews design decisions. |
| **Frontend / Client-Side Developer** | Implements user interface and integrates with backend APIs. Ensures responsive layouts, client-side validation, and smooth UX. |
