## Database Design

### Key Entities
1. **User**
   - Fields: id, name, email, password_hash, role  
   - Description: Represents all users (hosts, guests, admins). A user can own multiple properties.

2. **Property**
   - Fields: id, owner_id, title, description, price_per_night, location  
   - Description: Represents a property listed by a host. Each property belongs to one user.

3. **Booking**
   - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, total_amount  
   - Description: Represents a reservation by a guest for a specific property.

4. **Review**
   - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at  
   - Description: Stores user feedback for properties.

5. **Payment**
   - Fields: id, booking_id, amount, method, status, transaction_date  
   - Description: Records all financial transactions related to bookings.

### Relationships
- One user can own multiple properties.  
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.  
- Each booking is linked to one user and one property.  
- Each booking has one corresponding payment.

## Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **User Management** | Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. |
| **Property Management** | Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. |
| **Booking System** | Enables guests to make and manage reservations. |
| **Review System** | Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties. |
| **Payment Integration** | Processes secure payments using gateways like Stripe or PayPal. |
| **Search and Filtering** | Provides search functionality based on location, price, and date. |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Allows administrators to monitor activities and manage the platform. |

---

## API Security

| Security Measure | Implementation | Importance |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Implemented using JWT or OAuth2 tokens. | Ensures only verified users access the system. |
| **Authorization** | Role-based access control for guests, hosts, and admins. | Restricts unauthorized actions. |
| **Input Validation** | Sanitizes user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS. | Protects against malicious attacks. |
| **HTTPS Encryption** | Enforces SSL/TLS for all data transfers. | Secures sensitive information in transit. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limits repeated API requests from a single IP. | Prevents brute-force and denial-of-service attacks. |
| **Error Logging** | Captures and monitors backend errors securely. | Supports system monitoring and auditing. |

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the application.  
It ensures consistent code quality and faster delivery cycles.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions:** For automated testing, linting, and deployment.  
- **Docker:** For containerized builds and deployments.  
- **Heroku / Render / AWS:** For hosting and scaling the production environment.

### Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.  
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers test and build pipelines.  
3. Successful builds are deployed to the staging or production environment.  
4. Continuous monitoring ensures system reliability and fast rollback if needed.

## Conclusion
The Airbnb Clone Project demonstrates end-to-end understanding of backend engineering, database management, API design, and DevOps principles.  
It prepares learners for professional software development by emphasizing teamwork, scalability, and security in modern application design.
